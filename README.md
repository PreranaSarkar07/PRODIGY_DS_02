# Task 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset

This project is part of my internship with **Prodigy Infotech** under the **Data Science Track**.

## 📌 Objective
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset to identify patterns, trends, and relationships between variables.

## 🧠 Dataset
- **Dataset Used**: Titanic Dataset  
- Provided by Prodigy Infotech

## 🔍 What I Did
- Loaded the dataset and understood its structure
- Handled missing values and cleaned the data
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized important patterns (e.g., survival rate by gender/class/age)
- Identified correlations between features

## 📈 Key Insights
- Females had a higher survival rate than males
- Passengers in higher classes had better chances of survival
- Children and younger passengers had higher survival rates

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab
